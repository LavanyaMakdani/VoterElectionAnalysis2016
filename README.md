# VoterElectionAnalysis2016
A small project to analyse voter's exposure to untrustworthy websites in the US 2016 election. Based on a research paper by Brendan Nyhan (professor at Dartmouth college). Took data from the master file for the same research paper off of the Harvard database (link: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YLW1AZ)
